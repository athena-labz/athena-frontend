            Differently from traditional currencies, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum, DigiServices tokens (DSET) are not deflationary. This is important in order to incentivise cooperative and honest behaviour in the platform. A fixed amount of DSET tokens is monthly minted and distributed according to a Credit Assessment System (CAS). Users receive tokens proportionally to their scores.

        In order to de-incentive dishonest behaviour, DigiServices makes it possible for service providers to lock an arbitrary amount of tokens (Trust Token, TT) into the contract proposal in the marketplace and request from the client the same amount. In this way, there is commitment by both parties and a pledge in case of a conflict.

        Thus DSET utility provides the basis for a trustworthy platform by setting a good measure of reliability through the CAS (Credit Assessment System);furthermore it is an important element for the decentralized voting mechanism about the platform development.
